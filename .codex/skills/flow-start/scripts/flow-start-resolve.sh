# flow-start-resolve.sh - Deterministic Step-1 resolver for /flow:auto and
# /flow:start (issue #581).
#
# Motivation: flow Step 1 used to be driven by multi-line inline bash blocks
# (variable assignments, loops, command substitution). The permission matcher
# can only auto-allow commands it can decompose into allowlisted prefixes, so
# those compound blocks prompted on EVERY run regardless of allowlist tuning
# (issue #482 census evidence; the rejected sandbox lane #541/ADR 0002 attacked
# the same root cause). This helper extracts that plumbing into one audited,
# allowlistable script: it resolves the target repo (#578), fetches the issue,
# derives the issue-anchored branch, triages existing work, wraps the #503
# live-driver guard, and performs the git-lane worktree creation itself. The
# model reads the key=value contract below and makes exactly one decision:
# call EnterWorktree, or ride the git lane (cd).
#
# Resolve mode:
#   flow-start-resolve.sh <ISSUE> [PROJECT] [--session-cwd PATH] [--allow-closed]
#
#   PROJECT        target repo when the session cwd is not the issue's repo
#                  (issue #578): tried as a path first, else
#                  $HOME/Projects/<PROJECT>.
#   --session-cwd  the CLAUDE SESSION's working directory, passed verbatim by
#                  auto.md / start.md (issue #592). This is NOT the same thing
#                  as the process cwd: the Bash tool's cwd persists across calls
#                  and drifts whenever any earlier command `cd`s somewhere,
#                  while EnterWorktree always acts on the session cwd, which
#                  never moves. Inferring the session repo from `.` therefore
#                  decides GIT_LANE against whatever repo the last `cd` landed
#                  in. May also be supplied as FLOW_SESSION_CWD.
#                  When ABSENT the resolver falls back to `.` (nothing
#                  regresses) but says so - SESSION_CWD_INFERRED=1 - and fails
#                  closed to GIT_LANE=1, because the git lane is correct in
#                  every case while a wrong GIT_LANE=0 points EnterWorktree at
#                  a directory that may not be a repo at all.
#   --allow-closed proceed with worktree creation although the issue is not
#                  OPEN (pass only after the user has confirmed).
#
#   Prints a key=value contract (stdout), one value per line:
#     LANE=current-branch|fresh|resume|remote-pickup|local-pickup|cross-repo
#     CROSS_REPO=0|1        1 = the target repo is not the session repo (#578)
#     GIT_LANE=0|1          1 = ride the git lane end-to-end: enter with `cd`,
#                           never EnterWorktree, git cleanup at Step 7. Since
#                           worktrees are created OUTSIDE the repo by default
#                           (issue #627), this is ALWAYS 1 - the native
#                           EnterWorktree fresh lane is retired (#440 superseded).

#                           so the process cwd was used as a stand-in and the
#                           run may be resolving against a drifted directory

# for the Step-4 test loop collides on the published port and leaks
# <basename>_pgdata / <basename>_default orphans). Emit the canonical pin once so
# every later step and every hand-run make in the worktree can inherit it.
# Precedence matches Step 9: an explicit .claude/deploy.yaml override, else the
# canonical primary-checkout basename (TARGET_REPO), never the worktree basename.
# Portable extraction (no grep -P: BSD grep on macOS lacks it, and the PCRE
# shape silently matched nothing there, dropping the override - found via #742's gate).
