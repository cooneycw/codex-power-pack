# flow-helpers-install.sh - Install the flow helper family into <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/
# (issue #590).
#
# Problem:
#   ADR 0001 Phase B5 made `/plugin install flow@cpp` the canonical install path,
#   but the flow commands call ~14 helper scripts that only the repo-local
#   `/cpp:init` / `/cpp:update` installer ever linked into <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/. A
#   marketplace-only user got exit 127 at Step 1 of /flow:start and /flow:auto,
#   with auto.md explicitly forbidding an inline-bash workaround (#581).
#
#   Bundling the helpers in the plugin (plugin-sync EXTRA_FILES, the same
#   mechanism the secrets plugin uses for its masking hook, #479) is only half
#   the fix: the #581 allowlist rules in templates/claude-settings-permissions.json
#   match the STABLE bare path `<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/<helper>`, never a versioned
#   plugin-cache path. So the bundled copies still have to reach that path - this
#   script is what puts them there, from whichever source exists.
#
# Source selection (first match wins):
#   1. A CPP checkout (this script's own dir is <checkout>/scripts) -> SYMLINK,
#      so the helpers follow `git pull` exactly as /cpp:init Tier 2 does today.
#   2. A plugin bundle (this script's own dir is <plugin>/scripts, no CLAUDE.md
#      one level up) -> COPY. Plugin cache paths are version-stamped
#      (.../cpp/flow/1.0.0/...), so a symlink into one dangles on the next plugin
#      upgrade; a copy never dangles, and --check detects when it goes stale.
#
# Usage:
#   flow-helpers-install.sh            # install/refresh, idempotent
#   flow-helpers-install.sh --check    # read-only: report ok/missing/stale, exit 1 if any
#   flow-helpers-install.sh --force    # overwrite even when content already matches
#
# Output ends with a machine-readable verdict line:
#   FLOW_HELPERS: ok | installed | missing | stale | error
#
# Env (test hooks - unset in normal use):
#   FLOW_HELPERS_HOME      override $HOME (install target root)
#   FLOW_HELPERS_SOURCE    override the source dir (skips detection)
