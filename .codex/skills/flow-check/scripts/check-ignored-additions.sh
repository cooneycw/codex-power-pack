# check-ignored-additions.sh - Warn when a working-tree file is git-ignored
# but looks like an intentional source addition (the blanket-ignore trap).
#
# Motivation: .gitignore uses blanket rules with hand-maintained negation
# allow-lists (e.g. `*.json` + `!package.json` + `!renovate.json`, or the
# `.dockerignore *.md` incident in agentic-asst #452). When you author a new
# file the repo *should* track, `git add` silently no-ops - nothing fails
# until someone notices the file never got committed. This guard makes that
# loud instead of silent.
#
# Strategy: `git status --ignored=matching` lists every ignored file
# individually (it does NOT collapse whole ignored directories the way the
# default mode does, so a file in a brand-new all-ignored directory is still
# seen). We then drop the usual scratch/build noise by scanning each path
# component against a known set of cache/venv/build dir names, plus a few
# scratch file patterns. We also drop a short allow-list of files that are
# git-ignored BY DESIGN (env-only, per-machine runtime state that can never be
# an intended source addition) so the guard stops crying wolf on them every run
# (issue #504). What remains is an ignored file sitting in a tracked source
# area - the trap - which we warn about. Near-zero false positives against
# normal venv/cache noise.
#
# Usage:
#   check-ignored-additions.sh [--strict]
#
# Options:
#   --strict   Exit non-zero (3) when suspicious ignored files are found.
#              Default is advisory: always exit 0, just print the warning.
#
# Output:
#   Prints a "[flow] WARNING" block listing suspicious ignored files with a
#   remediation hint. Prints nothing (exit 0) when clean.
