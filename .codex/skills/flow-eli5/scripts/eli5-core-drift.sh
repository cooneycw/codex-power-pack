# eli5-core-drift.sh - advisory drift check for the vendored eli5 necessity gate.
#
# CPP's /flow:eli5 vendors its core (the section between the eli5-core:begin /
# eli5-core:end markers) verbatim from the canonical standalone repo
# https://github.com/cooneycw/eli5-gate (extracted in issue #443). This script
# fetches the canonical copy and diffs the marker-delimited core against the
# local vendored copy.
#
# Advisory and fail-open by design: network down or canonical unreachable ->
# exit 0 with a note; drift found -> warn with the diff and exit 1 so a CI step
# or /flow gate CAN choose to surface it, but nothing in the flow hard-fails on
# it. Reconcile drift by editing the CANONICAL repo first, then re-vendoring.
