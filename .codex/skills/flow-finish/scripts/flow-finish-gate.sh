# flow-finish-gate.sh - Deterministic quality-gate runner invocation for the
# flow commands (issue #613, the #581 pattern).
#
# Problem:
#   /flow:auto Step 6 (and the Step-7/merge re-gate, /flow:finish Step 2) run
#   the deterministic CI/CD runner as:
#
#       PYTHONPATH="$CPP_DIR:$PYTHONPATH" uv run --project "$CPP_DIR" \
#           python -m lib.cicd run --plan finish
#
#   A leading env-var assignment plus an interpolated $CPP_DIR can never match
#   a permission allow-rule PREFIX, so the line prompts as CODE-EXEC on every
#   finish and every merge re-gate. Same structural friction #581 removed from
#   Step 1 by extracting flow-start-resolve.sh: put the compound plumbing in
#   ONE audited script at a stable path, allowlist that path, invoke it BARE.
#
# What it does:
#   Resolves the CPP checkout, checks `uv`, and invokes the runner with the
#   documented PYTHONPATH / `uv run --project` contract (PYTHONPATH names the
#   PARENT of lib/ so `-m lib.cicd` resolves for external projects too, and uv
#   pins the >= 3.11 interpreter plus pydantic - issue #430). When the runner
#   is unavailable it degrades to `make lint` + `make test` + `make typecheck`,
#   the same fallback the command docs describe; with no Makefile gates either,
#   it skips loudly. The fallback mirrors the runner's `finish` plan target for
#   target: when it ran only lint + test it reproduced the exact false green the
#   plan itself had (issue #617) for every repo without uv or a CPP checkout.
#
# Usage:
#   flow-finish-gate.sh                  # run the 'finish' quality-gate plan
#   flow-finish-gate.sh --plan check     # pass a different plan through
#   flow-finish-gate.sh --check-summary  # lib.cicd check --summary (Makefile
#                                        # completeness, advisory: always exit 0)
#
# Output ends with a machine-readable verdict line:
#   FLOW_FINISH_GATE: ok | fail | warn | skipped
# A first-attempt failure cleared by the one targeted re-run also prints:
#   RERUN_PASSED: <space-separated pytest node ids>
#
#   ok      gate passed AND every gate actually executed        -> exit 0
#   fail    gate failed                                         -> exit 1
#   warn    --check-summary found gaps (advisory), OR the gate   -> exit 0
#           passed but a gate proved nothing: a quality gate was
#           SKIPPED (issue #628 - `warn (skipped gates: ...)`),
#           or a test step exited 0 having executed no tests
#           (issue #621), OR a failed test was re-run against only
#           its failed ids and PASSED (issue #769 - `warn (rerun
#           passed: ...)`). Every qualification names the reason.
#   skipped no runner AND no Makefile/pyproject gates to run     -> exit 0
#
# The #621/#628/#769 qualification exists because this helper is the layer the flow
# commands read: a runner that carefully reports "completed WITH WARNINGS"
# would be flattened back to a bare `ok` here, re-hiding the false green one
# level up. Both the runner and the Makefile-less fallback now prefer a gate's
# Makefile target but fall back to `uv run --extra dev <tool>` when pyproject
# configures the tool (issue #628), so a gate SKIPS only when it genuinely
# cannot run - and then it is named, never a silent ok. Exit status is
# unchanged (0) - the warning is a signal, not a gate.
#
# The #769 opt-in reaches the runner as an environment variable, not a CLI flag,
# because this helper invokes whatever CPP checkout is installed. That checkout
# may predate #769: an unknown env var is ignored, while an unknown argparse flag
# is a hard error that prevents the quality gate from running at all.
#
# Env (test hooks - unset in normal use):
#   FLOW_GATE_CPP_DIR   override the CPP checkout path (set empty to force
#                       "no checkout found" and exercise the fallback)
#   FLOW_GATE_RERUN     set to 0 to disable the #769 targeted re-run and get
#                       the pre-#769 first-failure-is-fail behaviour
