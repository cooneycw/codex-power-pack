# flow-stale-check.sh - Detect a STALE BASE early in the flow (issue #473).
#
# Problem:
#   /flow:auto's #462 guard only notices that `origin/main` moved at Step 7
#   (merge time). When sibling PRs land DURING implementation - the common case
#   for serialization hotspots (.claude/commands/flow/*.md, CHANGELOG.md, the
#   CLAUDE.md inventory) - the edits were made against stale versions of the very
#   files the siblings changed, forcing a `git reset`/`git merge` + re-apply cycle
#   regardless. Observed on flow:auto #444, #463, #461.
#
# This helper surfaces the collision EARLY (Step 4 start-of-implement and Step 6
# finish), NAMING which file(s) you have touched that also changed upstream, so
# you can merge `origin/main` in now - before more edits pile onto a stale base.
# It COMPLEMENTS the #462 Step-7 guard (which stays as the final backstop); it
# does not replace it.
#
# It is ADVISORY and FAIL-OPEN: it never blocks the flow (exit 0) unless
# --exit-code is passed, and a missing base ref / not-a-repo / fetch failure is
# reported and shrugged off, never fatal.
#
# Usage:
#   flow-stale-check.sh [BASE_REF] [--no-fetch] [--exit-code]
#
#   BASE_REF     Ref to compare against (default: origin/main).
#   --no-fetch   Skip `git fetch` (offline / tests / already fetched).
#   --exit-code  Return non-zero (1) when a COLLISION is detected; still 0 for
#                "current" and "moved-clean". Default is always-0 (advisory).
#
# Output ends with a machine-readable verdict line:
#   FLOW_STALE_BASE: current | moved-clean | collision | unknown
#
# Env (test hook - unset in normal use):
#   FLOW_STALE_GIT   override the `git` binary (default: git)
