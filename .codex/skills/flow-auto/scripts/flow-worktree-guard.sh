# flow-worktree-guard.sh - Warn when a flow edit LEAKED into the MAIN repo
# working tree instead of landing in the active worktree (issue #486).
#
# Motivation: in a linked git worktree session the session cwd IS the
# worktree, but the worktree physically lives inside the main repo at
# `.codex/worktrees/<name>/`. A `Write`/`Edit` given a hand-built ABSOLUTE
# `.codex/worktrees/<name>/...` path has been observed (flow:auto #442 x2, #471)
# to modify the file in the MAIN repo working tree instead of the worktree - work
# looks done but is written to the wrong tree, either lost or left as a stray
# dirty file on main that other concurrent sessions then see.
#
# The durable fix is a directive: resolve edit paths from
# `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (the active worktree root), never a hand-built
# `.codex/worktrees/...` absolute path. This guard is the VERIFIABLE backstop for
# that directive: run from inside a linked worktree, it inspects the MAIN repo's
# TRACKED working tree for the leaked-edit signature - so the trap is caught
# before commit rather than discovered later.
#
# To avoid crying wolf (issue #536), it does NOT warn about every dirty file in
# main: the main checkout often carries PRE-EXISTING local modifications
# unrelated to this run (deploy configs, etc.), and flagging those as a leak
# buries the real signal. A dirty main file is treated as a leak only when it
# ALSO appears among the paths THIS run edited (branch commits vs the base, plus
# worktree dirt) - i.e. the run tried to touch that path yet it shows up modified
# in main. Overlapping dirt -> a loud WARNING (and a --strict failure);
# non-overlapping dirt -> a quiet info note, never a failure. Trade-off: a pure
# leak of a file the worktree never also edited is downgraded to info - the
# accepted cost of killing the recurring false positives.
#
# Scope: only meaningful in a linked-worktree session (`.git` is a file). In the
# main checkout itself (`.git` is a directory) there is no "other tree" to leak
# into, so the guard is a no-op. A git-fallback worktree (manual `git worktree
# add`, cwd not a native session) does not hit the trap either, but the main-tree
# cleanliness check is still valid there, so it runs in any linked worktree.
#
# Usage:
#   flow-worktree-guard.sh [--strict]
#
# Options:
#   --strict   Exit non-zero (3) ONLY when a main modification OVERLAPS a path
#              this run edited (the leak signature). Non-overlapping pre-existing
#              dirt never fails, even under --strict. Default is advisory:
#              always exit 0, just warn/note.
#
# Output:
#   - Overlap (leak): a "[flow] WARNING" block naming the overlapping paths with
#     a remediation hint (and, under --strict, exit 3).
#   - Non-overlap only: a quiet "[flow] note" listing the pre-existing main
#     modifications, exit 0.
#   - Nothing (exit 0) when main is clean or when not in a linked worktree.
#
# Env (test hook - unset in normal use):
#   FLOW_WORKTREE_GIT   override the `git` binary (default: git)
