# worktree-remove.sh - Safely remove git worktrees
#
# If you're inside the worktree being removed, the script automatically
# changes to the main repository first (determined from the worktree's
# .git file) to prevent breaking your shell session.
#
# A worktree CLAIMED by another live /flow session (issue #597) is never
# removed: the claim is checked first and a live foreign owner is a hard stop
# (exit 4), because removing it is exactly the silent-data-loss failure that
# motivated the claim. A self-owned or stale claim is released and removed as
# usual, and --steal is the deliberate override.
#
# Usage:
#   worktree-remove.sh <worktree-path> [--force] [--delete-branch] [--steal]
#
# Options:
#   --force          Remove even if worktree has uncommitted changes
#   --delete-branch  Also delete the associated branch after removal
#   --steal          Remove even when another live session claims it (#597)
#
# Examples:
#   worktree-remove.sh /home/user/Projects/nhl-api-issue-42
#   worktree-remove.sh ../nhl-api-issue-42 --delete-branch
#   worktree-remove.sh /home/user/Projects/nhl-api-issue-42 --force --delete-branch
