# gh-pr-merge.sh - Squash-merge a PR robustly from any git worktree layout.
#
# Problem (issue #461):
#   From inside a LINKED worktree - a native `../<repo>-<branch>/<name>` checkout
#   or a legacy sibling dir - `gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch` fails
#   AFTER the remote merge has already succeeded:
#
#     failed to run git: fatal: 'main' is already checked out at '<main-repo>'
#
#   gh, having merged and deleted the remote branch, tries to switch THIS worktree
#   off the now-gone branch onto the default branch - which is checked out in the
#   primary worktree, so the local checkout errors and gh exits non-zero. The
#   remote squash still landed (and `Closes #N` still fired); only gh's local
#   post-merge step failed. Callers that trust the exit code read this as a failed
#   merge and stop - a false negative that cost a full re-diagnosis on flow:auto
#   #433.
#
# Transient un-mergeability (issue #485):
#   Right after a `git push`, GitHub is still asynchronously computing the PR's
#   mergeability, so `gh pr view --json mergeable` returns UNKNOWN for a beat and a
#   raw `gh pr merge` fails with "Pull Request is not mergeable". That is a purely
#   transient blip - a re-check moments later returns MERGEABLE and the squash
#   succeeds. To stop that from being a false STOP, poll mergeability before the
#   merge: proceed only on MERGEABLE, hard-stop on a genuine CONFLICTING, and
#   fail-open (attempt the merge anyway) if it never resolves - the post-merge
#   MERGED-state check below stays the final backstop.
#
# Base moved at squash time (issue #502):
#   A sibling merge can advance the base in the poll-to-merge race window. Native
#   CxPP treats that rejection as a clean stop instead of retrying after only a
#   refetch and mergeability poll. Re-run the helper to repeat the complete
#   head/base/status/review clearance before another exact-head attempt.
#
# Branch protection blocks an owner merge (issue #517):
#   With main branch-protected (PR + review + CI required, the #449 posture), a
#   repo owner's squash is rejected by GitHub until it is re-run with --admin, so
#   every owner merge otherwise stalls at a manual `gh pr merge --squash --admin`.
#   Handle it two ways: an opt-in --admin flag that forces the override from the
#   first attempt, and - when a squash fails with a protection-block message, the
#   caller did not pass --admin, and the actor is a repo admin - a single
#   automatic retry with --admin. The override only ever fires for a repo admin,
#   only once, and the MERGED-state check below stays authoritative. --admin
#   bypasses every protection at once (including a red required check), so the
#   auto-retry is deliberately bounded and admin-gated.
#
# Required status checks are WAITED FOR, never overridden (issue #577, ADR 0004):
#   With a required status check on the base branch (CPP's posture makes the
#   Woodpecker PR pipeline required), a squash attempted the instant after a push
#   is rejected because the check has not reported yet. The #517 auto-retry above
#   would then "fix" that by merging with --admin - bypassing the very check the
#   posture exists to enforce, on every single run. That is protection theatre.
#   So: before merging, resolve the base branch's required contexts and POLL the
#   PR head until they are green; hard-stop on a genuinely red one; and exclude a
#   required-status-check block from the --admin auto-retry (a review block, the
#   #517 case, is unchanged). An explicit --admin from the caller still skips the
#   wait - a conscious owner override is the documented break-glass.
#
# The wait must never fire on contexts it only IMAGINED (issue #610):
#   The #577 resolver read one endpoint - classic branch protection - and threw
#   away its exit code. Two independent consequences, and both of them turned a
#   green PR into a 10-minute stall plus a hard refusal (25 flow:auto runs,
#   roughly 4h of wall-clock, every one ending in a manual `gh pr merge --squash`):
#     1. `gh api` prints the ERROR body on stdout WITHOUT applying --jq, so a 404
#        `{"message":"Branch not protected", ...}` was mapped straight into the
#        required-contexts list. The wait then polled for a context literally
#        named `{"message": ...` - which can never report - and hard-stopped.
#     2. GitHub declares required checks through TWO mechanisms, and the legacy
#        endpoint cannot see the modern one: a branch guarded by a repository
#        RULESET returns that same 404, so a repo that genuinely does require a
#        check reads as unprotected.
#   So resolution now reads BOTH sources - /branches/{b}/protection/... and
#   /repos/{o}/{r}/rules/branches/{b} - treats ONLY a 2xx response as data, and
#   reports one of three states: `declared` (wait, exactly as #577 does),
#   `none` (a source answered and nothing is required -> skip the wait), or
#   `unresolved` (neither source readable -> fall back to what the PR itself
#   reports). Enumeration failure is no longer allowed to outrank observed
#   reality, and the client-side wait is defence in depth: GitHub enforces the
#   posture server-side at squash time, so a plain `gh pr merge --squash` cannot
#   bypass a ruleset even when this script decides not to wait.
#
# Base moved DURING the required-check wait (issue #767):
#   /flow:auto syncs the branch with the base and re-runs the quality gate before
#   invoking this helper, but the required-check wait can then last several
#   minutes. A sibling PR can advance the base during that window, leaving the
#   checks green for a tree that is no longer the tree the squash would land.
#   Snapshot the fetched base tip before the non-admin wait and compare it after
#   the checks succeed. An unchanged tip, or a new tip already contained in HEAD,
#   proceeds; unreadable snapshots fail open. A changed tip not contained in HEAD
#   is a clean exit-6 stop before the review gate or squash work. The explicit
#   --allow-base-move flag is the loud, per-merge override; --admin skips this
#   guard together with the queue and required-check waits it already bypasses.
#
# This wrapper makes the merge layout-aware:
#   * Linked worktree (cwd's `.git` is a FILE): run `gh pr merge --squash` WITHOUT
#     --delete-branch so gh never attempts the local branch switch, then delete the
#     REMOTE branch ourselves (what --delete-branch would have done). Local worktree
#     + branch removal is left to the caller (worktree-remove.sh / ExitWorktree),
#     so the native cleanup path is unaffected.
#   * Primary repo (cwd's `.git` is a DIRECTORY): keep --delete-branch; the local
#     switch to the default branch is safe there.
#   * Either way, verify the PR actually reached MERGED before returning non-zero,
#     so a stray local post-merge error is never mistaken for a merge failure.
#
# Usage:  gh-pr-merge.sh [--admin] [--allow-negated-close] [--allow-incidental-close] [--allow-base-move] <pr-number> <branch-name>
#           --admin  force `gh pr merge --admin` from the first attempt - the
#                    conscious, HUMAN-TYPED branch-protection override (issues
#                    #517/#579). It skips the required-check wait AND the review
#                    gate. Without it, administrative protection is reported without retry; an explicit owner
#                    invocation is required for any --admin override
#                    (protected-branch / push-authorization / base-branch-policy
#                    blocks) - never for a required status check (#577) and never
#                    for a required review (#579): automation must not bypass a
#                    human-approval control.
#           --allow-negated-close  consciously bypass the issue #726 refusal
#                    after the detected trigger and surrounding text are printed;
#                    this is a loud, per-merge override, never persistent config.
#           --allow-incidental-close  consciously bypass the issue #794 refusal
#                    (a close/fix/resolve keyword adjacent to #N that reads as
#                    incidental, not a directive) after the detected trigger and
#                    surrounding text are printed; loud, per-merge, never
#                    persistent config.
#           --allow-base-move  consciously bypass the issue #767 clean stop when
#                    the base advances during the required-check wait; the moved
#                    tips and an override-consumed audit line are still printed.
# Deletion surfacing + post-merge completeness (issue #657):
#   A collapse onto a moved base (`git reset --soft origin/main` + commit, the
#   #655-thread workaround) silently records the DELETION of everything the
#   moved base added - poker-measure lost a merged 2,085-line feature this way
#   with a conflict-free merge and honestly-green CI. GitHub cannot distinguish
#   authored deletions from collapse damage at merge time (the damage IS inside
#   the PR's own file list - incident PR #234 listed all 40 paths), so this
#   helper does the two things that ARE sound here, both fail-open (#610
#   posture: enumeration failure never outranks observed reality):
#     * BEFORE the squash, surface every path the PR deletes vs its base -
#       `GH_PR_MERGE_DELETIONS: <n> <paths...>` (or `0`, or `skipped` when the
#       diff is unreadable) - so a reviewer/orchestrator sees "this squash
#       lands N deletions" while there is still time to stop. Opt-in
#       GH_PR_MERGE_STRICT_DELETIONS=1 turns any surfaced deletion into a
#       CLEAN pre-squash stop (exit 4, PR untouched).
#     * AFTER a confirmed merge, verify the landed squash commit touched ONLY
#       paths in the PR's file list - `GH_PR_MERGE_COMPLETENESS: ok|violation|
#       skipped`. A violation is LOUD but never flips the exit code (the merge
#       already landed); it catches base-race/squash contamination, and
#       honestly does NOT catch the collapse incident (damage inside the file
#       list) - that guard lives at collapse time (auto.md Step 6 recipe).
#   All git reads here are ref-scoped (`git -C <root>`, full refs, no bare
#   relative pathspecs) - the companion #657 finding: a cwd-drifted relative
#   pathspec reads as an empty diff, indistinguishable from "no changes".
#
# Negated close keywords still close issues (issues #726 and #772):
#   GitHub matches a literal close/fix/resolve keyword plus `#N` even when prose
#   negates it, so "does not close #N" closes the issue when the squash lands.
#   Author-time prose cannot reliably prevent that composition trap. Immediately
#   before the squash, scan the exact title/body being sent, trim each keyword's
#   prefix at the nearest sentence or clause boundary, and recognize only an
#   adjacent negation with at most two intervening words. CLEAN STOP before any
#   merge attempt. The per-invocation --allow-negated-close escape hatch stays
#   loud: it prints every detected issue/context plus an audit line before
#   deliberately proceeding.
#
# Incidental proximity also closes issues, and every PR commit is a surface
# (issue #794): GitHub matches close/fix/resolve + #N by proximity, ignoring
# grammar - a keyword that is not a directive at all, merely adjacent, still
# closes on squash. Two real near-misses: a commit subject where the keyword was
# an ADJECTIVE ("...with the resolved #N/topic finding") and a PR body where the
# keyword governed a different noun ("closes #N's investigation against..."),
# neither negated so #726's guard does not see them. A closing directive is
# conventionally the whole clause (`Closes #N` at a line/clause start); flag
# instead when the keyword is NOT clause-initial, or when #N is immediately
# followed by a possessive or a slash-compound modifier (the two concrete shapes
# above), on the title, body, AND every commit subject on the PR branch - the
# squash composes its message from the PR's own commits whenever neither
# --subject nor --body is supplied (issue #716 above), so a `git commit -m`
# typed inline is exactly as much a closing surface as the PR description, and
# never passes through whatever review the body gets. Same CLEAN STOP shape as
# #726, and its own --allow-incidental-close escape hatch. The guard verifies
# its own classifier against a fixed, unreachable-numbered self-check pair
# before trusting a clean scan - a scan that silently cannot run must never
# read the same as a scan that ran and found nothing (this repo has hit exactly
# that failure mode before: a regex that could not compile printed no output
# and was indistinguishable from a clean result).
#
# Squash-commit trailer carries the tested tree hash (issue #716):
#   poker-measure's CI throughput on its single shared Woodpecker agent
#   (WOODPECKER_MAX_WORKFLOWS=2) is capped enough that every squash-to-main
#   re-runs the full suite and competes for a scarce slot with the next PR's
#   pipeline (poker-measure#236). When this PR's branch was up to date with
#   its base at squash time - no intervening base commits since the branch
#   point - the squashed tree is PROVABLY identical to the PR head that
#   already passed CI, so this helper appends a git trailer naming the TESTED
#   TREE HASH: `Woodpecker-Tested-Tree: <sha1 of HEAD^{tree}>`. Deliberately
#   NOT a boolean trailer - `gh pr merge --squash` composes the squash body
#   from the PR's own commits when neither --subject nor --body is given, so
#   a bare `Woodpecker-Skip-Full-Test: true` typed into ANY commit message
#   would silently propagate and skip the consuming CI's full suite with this
#   script's up-to-date check never consulted. The tree hash is
#   self-verifying instead: the consumer (poker-measure/.woodpecker.yml)
#   recomputes `git rev-parse HEAD^{tree}` on the squash commit it just
#   checked out and skips only when it EQUALS this value - forging a skip
#   then requires naming the exact tree hash of genuinely matching content.
#   Fail-open per component (the #610 posture): an unreadable base, an
#   unresolvable ancestry check, or a branch behind its base all omit the
#   trailer, and the consumer's push pipeline runs the full suite - the safe
#   default either way.
#
# Poll window vs. CI queue depth (issue #717):
#   The required-check poll below (GH_PR_MERGE_CHECK_ATTEMPTS x
#   GH_PR_MERGE_CHECK_DELAY) counts from when polling STARTS, not from when
#   the pipeline is actually picked up - so on the same shared 2-worker
#   Woodpecker agent, a PR that sits queued behind others eats into the same
#   budget as one that is genuinely stuck. Measured the same night: 8 of 8
#   poker-measure merges needed exactly one retry - a deterministic tax, not
#   an intermittent fault. GitHub's classic commit-status API - what
#   Woodpecker posts (`ci/woodpecker/pr/woodpecker`) - has no queued-vs-
#   running distinction in its `state` field (only GitHub Check Runs expose
#   that), so the fix asks Woodpecker's OWN pipeline API instead: when
#   WOODPECKER_API_TOKEN is set (the same credential /flow:auto Step 8 uses
#   for post-merge CI verification), wait out a QUEUED pipeline on a separate
#   bounded budget (GH_PR_MERGE_QUEUE_WAIT_ATTEMPTS x
#   GH_PR_MERGE_QUEUE_WAIT_DELAY) before the existing check-poll budget
#   starts counting - so that budget only has to cover genuine run time.
#   Entirely fail-open: no token, no curl/jq, an unresolvable repo id, or no
#   matching pipeline all fall straight through to the unchanged pre-#717
#   poll. This can only ever shrink the effective wait; it is never a new way
#   to stop the merge.
#
# Stacked dependent PRs are retargeted before branch deletion (poker-measure#405):
#   During the 2026-08-20 poker wave merge drain, squash-merging PR #375 through
#   this helper deleted its branch and GitHub auto-closed open PR #382, whose base
#   was that branch, in the same second. GitHub retargets stacked children only
#   in its web-UI merge flow, not when the API/CLI squash and branch deletion used
#   here remove the base ref. Before any squash attempt, enumerate every open PR
#   based on `$BRANCH` and retarget it to the repo's resolved default branch; the
#   temporarily inflated child diff self-corrects after the parent lands. The
#   operation is non-destructive and fail-open per the #610 posture: unreadable
#   enumeration/default metadata prints `GH_PR_MERGE_STACKED_RETARGET: skipped`,
#   while successful edits print `GH_PR_MERGE_STACKED_RETARGET: <n> <PRs...>`;
#   one failed child edit warns but never blocks the remaining edits or merge.
#
# Exit:   0  the PR is merged on the remote
#         1  the PR genuinely did not merge (conflicts, red required check,
#            unresolvable state)
#         2  usage error (bad flag or missing pr-number/branch-name)
#         3  CLEAN STOP, not a failure (issue #579): merge awaits a human review
#            (reviewDecision REVIEW_REQUIRED or CHANGES_REQUESTED). The PR is
#            left open, current, and green - approve or merge it on GitHub, then
#            resume with /flow:merge (or re-run with an explicit --admin to
#            consciously override the review requirement).
#         4  CLEAN STOP, not a failure (issue #657): GH_PR_MERGE_STRICT_DELETIONS=1
#            is set and the PR deletes files vs its base. The PR is left open and
#            untouched - review the surfaced paths, then re-run without strict
#            mode (or fix the branch) once the deletions are confirmed intended.
#         5  CLEAN STOP, not a failure (issue #726): the squash title, body, or a
#            commit subject on the branch has a negated close/fix/resolve
#            keyword that GitHub would still honor. The PR is left open and
#            untouched - reword it or consciously re-run with
#            --allow-negated-close after reviewing the printed context.
#         6  CLEAN STOP, not a failure (issue #767): the base advanced during the
#            required-check wait and its new tip is not contained in HEAD. The PR
#            is left open and untouched - sync the base, re-run the quality gate,
#            push, and re-run the merge (or consciously use --allow-base-move).
#         7  CLEAN STOP, not a failure (issue #794): the squash title, body, or a
#            commit subject on the branch has a close/fix/resolve keyword
#            adjacent to #N that is not actually a directive (not clause-
#            initial, or #N is immediately followed by a possessive or a
#            slash-compound). The PR is left open and untouched - reword it or
#            consciously re-run with --allow-incidental-close after reviewing
#            the printed context.
#         8  the incidental-close classifier (issue #794) failed its own
#            self-check - this is a BROKEN CHECK, not a clean scan, and is
#            never conflated with "no hazard found". Investigate the guard
#            itself before re-running; there is no override for this one.
