# Close GitHub Issue

Close an issue in the codex-power-pack repository.

## Usage

The user should provide an issue number. If not provided, ask for it.

## Flow

### Step 1: Verify Issue

First, fetch and display the issue to confirm:
```bash
gh issue view NUMBER --repo cooneycw/codex-power-pack
```

Show:
- Title
- Current state
- Labels
- Brief description

### Step 2: Ask for Closing Comment (Optional)

Ask if the user wants to add a closing comment. Common patterns:

- "Implemented in [commit/PR]"
- "Fixed in v1.x.x"
- "Duplicate of #XX"
- "Won't fix: [reason]"
- "Completed"

### Step 3: Close Reason (Optional)

For tracking purposes, ask about the close reason:
- **Completed** - Issue was resolved
- **Not Planned** - Won't be implemented
- **Duplicate** - Duplicate of another issue

```bash
# Close as completed (default)
gh issue close NUMBER --repo cooneycw/codex-power-pack

# Close as not planned
gh issue close NUMBER --repo cooneycw/codex-power-pack --reason "not planned"
```

### Step 4: Execute

If closing comment provided, add it first:
```bash
gh issue comment NUMBER --repo cooneycw/codex-power-pack --body "COMMENT"
```

Then close:
```bash
gh issue close NUMBER --repo cooneycw/codex-power-pack
```

### Step 5: Confirm

After closing, confirm success and show final state.
