# Self-Improvement Commands

Retrospective analysis commands that examine recent failures and suggest improvements to project tooling.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/self-improvement:deployment` | Analyze deployment errors and propose Makefile improvements |
| `/self-improvement:help` | This help page |

## Philosophy

The `/flow` workflow is forward-focused: start, implement, finish, merge, deploy. But when things go wrong, there is value in looking backward to improve the tooling itself.

Self-improvement commands:
- Examine errors from the current session and project history
- Identify patterns of recurring failure
- Propose concrete changes to build/deploy infrastructure
- Optionally apply approved changes

## When to Use

Run `/self-improvement:deployment` after:
- A failed `make deploy` or `make test`
- Repeated build failures in a session
- Setting up a new project's Makefile
- Periodically to audit Makefile quality against CPP standards

## Feedback Loop

```
/flow:deploy -> fails -> /self-improvement:deployment -> fix Makefile -> /flow:deploy -> succeeds
```

## Future Commands

The self-improvement category may grow to include:
- **test** - Analyze test failure patterns, suggest test infrastructure improvements
- **review** - Analyze PR review feedback patterns, suggest code quality improvements
- **session** - Analyze session patterns, suggest AGENTS.md improvements

| `/flow:finish` | Quality gates that depend on Makefile targets |
| `/security:scan` | Security-focused analysis (complementary) |
