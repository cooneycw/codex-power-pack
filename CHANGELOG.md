# Changelog

## [5.2.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added - C4 Diagram QA Framework

- **`validate_diagram` MCP tool** - Diagram quality checks: duplicate IDs, edge validity, viewport fit, readability, orphan nodes, WCAG AA contrast, long labels (#255)
- **Node density scoring** - Automatic overflow detection based on viewport capacity heuristics; status levels: ok, warning, overflow, critical (#262)
- **`split_diagram` MCP tool** - Auto-splits large diagrams (>15 nodes) into summary + detail sub-diagrams with three clustering strategies: `c4_boundary`, `connectivity`, `type_group` (#263)
- **Multi-diagram L3/L4 generation** - `/documentation:c4` generates L3 for all containers and L4 for top 3 components per container (#258)
- **`c4-manifest.json`** - Tracks all generated diagrams with parent-child relationships, node/edge counts, and split roles (#259)
- **`index.html` navigation page** - Hierarchical browser for all C4 diagrams with level badges and metadata (#260)
- **Shared theme token system** - `ThemeTokens` dataclass provides consistent color palette across all diagram types via `theme_id` and `theme_tokens` parameters (#261)
- **QA gating in c4 and pptx skills** - Post-generation warning inspection: EDGE_INVALID triggers retry (max 2), OVERFLOW triggers split, ORPHAN/LABELS logged as warnings; QA summary in final reports (#264)
- **Playwright session optimization** - PPTX skill uses ONE browser session for all diagram screenshots (#264)
- **Comprehensive test suite** - 285 new tests: validation, density scoring, split strategy, XSS sanitization, WCAG contrast, C4 integration (#265)

### Fixed

- **XSS vulnerability** - HTML-escape all node labels and descriptions in diagram HTML output (#256)
- **WCAG AA color contrast** - All C4 and generic palettes updated to meet 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio (#257)
