*From Codex Best Practices - r/ClaudeCode community wisdom*

## Key Insight from Power Users (685 upvotes)

**From "Codex is a Beast":**

**Skills with Pattern Matching:**
- Use hooks to pre-fetch skills for activation
- Skill = prompt injection + hook + pattern matching
- This dramatically improves skill activation rates

## Improving Skill Activation Rates (214 upvotes)

**From "Codex skills activate 20% of the time. Here's how I got to 84%"**

**Problem:** Default skill activation is around 20%

**Solution:**

1. **Detailed, Context-Rich Skills**
   - Include specific examples and patterns
   - Provide detailed guides for your framework
   - More context = better activation

2. **Pattern Matching**
   - Skills need clear trigger patterns
   - Use specific terminology that matches your codebase
   - Make triggers unambiguous

3. **Regular Testing & Refinement**
   - Test skill activation regularly
   - Refine based on what triggers successfully
   - Remove or merge underperforming skills

## Skills Best Practices

**From Community Discussion:**

- **Skills = Prompt Injection**
  - At core, skills are just specialized prompts
  - Power comes from combining with hooks and patterns
  - Think of them as reusable context modules

- **Don't Overload**
  - 1-3 well-crafted skills better than 10 mediocre ones
  - Each skill should have clear, distinct purpose
  - Avoid overlap between skills

- **Version Control Skills**
  - Keep skills in git
  - Share successful patterns with team
  - Document what triggers each skill

## Skill Structure

## Security Warning (80 upvotes)

**From "Be careful with people spreading Codex Skills as malware on Github":**

**Risk:** Skills can execute arbitrary code

**Protection:**
- Review skills before installing
- Use trusted sources only
