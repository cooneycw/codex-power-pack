# CI/CD & Verification

Build system detection, health checks, smoke tests, pipeline generation, container scaffolding, and the verification loop.

## The Verification Loop

```
code → lint/test → deploy → health check → smoke test → report
```

This is the core pattern: every deployment should be **verified** before it's considered complete. The `/flow` commands orchestrate this automatically when configured.

## Framework Detection

The CI/CD system auto-detects your project's framework and package manager:

| Framework | Package Managers | Detection |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Python | uv, pip | `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt` |
| Node.js | npm, yarn | `package.json` + lock files |
| Go | go | `go.mod` |
| Rust | cargo | `Cargo.toml` |
| Multi-language | any | Multiple indicators |

Run `/cicd:init` to detect and generate a Makefile from templates.

## Makefile Conventions

### Standard Targets

| Target | Required | Used By | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|
| `lint` | Yes | `/flow:finish` | Code linting |
| `test` | Yes | `/flow:finish` | Test suite |
| `format` | No | Manual/IDE | Code formatting |
| `typecheck` | No | `/cicd:check` | Type checking |
| `build` | No | Build step | Build artifacts |
| `deploy` | No | `/flow:deploy` | Production deploy |
| `clean` | No | Manual | Remove artifacts |
| `verify` | No | Pre-deploy | lint + test + typecheck |

### Best Practices

1. **Always use `uv run`** for Python commands (environment isolation)
2. **Declare `.PHONY`** for all non-file targets
3. **Add dependencies** - `deploy` should depend on `test` and `lint`
4. **Use `@` prefix** on informational `echo` commands to reduce noise
5. **Keep targets idempotent** - safe to run multiple times

### Example Makefile

```makefile
.PHONY: lint test format deploy clean verify

lint:
	uv run ruff check .

test:
	uv run pytest

format:
	uv run ruff format .

deploy: verify
	@echo "Deploying..."
	# your deploy commands here

verify: lint test

clean:
	rm -rf .pytest_cache __pycache__ dist/
```

## Health Check Configuration

Configure in `.codex/cicd.yml`:

```yaml
health:
  endpoints:
    - url: http://localhost:8000/health
      name: API Server
      expected_status: 200
      timeout: 5
    - url: http://localhost:3000
      name: Frontend
      expected_status: 200
  processes:
    - name: uvicorn
      port: 8000
    - name: node
      port: 3000
```

### Health Check Types

| Type | What It Checks | How |
|------|---------------|-----|
| **Endpoint** | HTTP response | `curl` with status code + timeout |
| **Process** | Service running | `ss`/`lsof` for port listening |

### Best Practices

- Check **both** endpoints and processes for critical services
- Set reasonable timeouts (5s default, 30s max)
- Use `/health` endpoints that verify dependencies (DB, cache)
- Run health checks **after** deploy, not during

## Smoke Test Configuration

```yaml
smoke_tests:
  - name: API responds
    command: "curl -sf http://localhost:8000/health"
    expected_exit: 0
  - name: CLI version
    command: "python -m myapp --version"
    expected_output: "v\\d+\\.\\d+"
  - name: Database connected
    command: "python -c 'from myapp.db import check; check()'"
    expected_exit: 0
```

### Smoke vs Health

| Aspect | Health Check | Smoke Test |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Speed | Fast (< 5s each) | Slower (may do I/O) |
| Scope | Is it running? | Does it work? |
| When | Continuous / post-deploy | Post-deploy only |
| Failure | Service down | Feature broken |

## CI/CD Pipeline Patterns

### GitHub Actions

Generated via `/cicd:pipeline` using templates in `templates/workflows/`:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml (generated)
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v4
      - run: make lint
      - run: make test
```

### Template Selection

Templates match detected framework:
- `python-uv.yml` - Python with uv
- `python-pip.yml` - Python with pip
- `node-npm.yml` - Node.js with npm
- `node-yarn.yml` - Node.js with yarn
- `go.yml` - Go
- `rust.yml` - Rust

## Container Best Practices

Generated via `/cicd:container` using templates in `templates/containers/`:

### Dockerfile Patterns

1. **Multi-stage builds** - separate build and runtime stages
2. **Non-root user** - always run as non-root in production
3. **Layer caching** - copy dependency files first, then source
4. **Health checks** - include `HEALTHCHECK` instruction
5. **Minimal base** - use slim/alpine variants

### docker-compose Patterns

1. **Named volumes** for persistent data
2. **Health checks** with retries and intervals
3. **Dependency ordering** with `depends_on` + `condition: service_healthy`
4. **Environment files** - use `.env` files, never hardcode secrets

## Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/cicd:init` | Detect framework, generate Makefile and cicd.yml |
| `/cicd:check` | Validate Makefile against CPP standards |
| `/cicd:health` | Run health checks (endpoints + processes) |
| `/cicd:smoke` | Run smoke tests from cicd.yml |
| `/cicd:container` | Generate Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml |
| `/cicd:help` | Overview of CI/CD commands |

## Integration with /flow

| Flow Command | CI/CD Integration |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `/flow:finish` | Runs `make lint` + `make test` as quality gates |
| `/flow:deploy` | Runs `make deploy`, then post-deploy health + smoke |
| `/flow:auto` | Full lifecycle including deploy verification |
| `/flow:doctor` | Reports Makefile target availability |
