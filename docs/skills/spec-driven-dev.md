# Spec-Driven Development

*From Codex Best Practices - r/ClaudeCode community wisdom*

## Why Spec-Driven Development? (107 upvotes)

**From "Why we shifted to Spec-Driven Development":**

**Problem:** As features multiply, consistency and quality suffer

**Solution:** Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

## The SDD Approach

1. **Write Detailed Specs First**
   - Before any code
   - Include edge cases
   - Define success criteria

2. **Review Specs, Not Just Code**
   - Easier to fix design issues before coding
   - Specs are cheaper to iterate than code
   - Gets team alignment early

3. **Use Specs as Reference**
   - Claude can check code against spec
   - Automated verification possible
   - Clear acceptance criteria

4. **Iterate on Specs**
   - Specs are living documents
   - Update based on learnings
   - Version control specs like code

## Spec-First → Sandbox → Production

**From 685 upvote post + community:**

1. **Write Spec**
   - Detailed requirements
   - Edge cases
   - Success criteria

2. **Sandbox Testing** (use Sonnet)
   - Separate directory for experiments
   - Verify key parts work
   - Try uncertain approaches

3. **Implementation** (Opus for complex, Sonnet for standard)
   - Cut-and-dry based on verified plan
   - Minimal decisions needed
   - Fast execution

4. **Review & Refine**
   - Test against spec
   - Iterate if needed
   - Git commit

## Tools

- **GitHub Spec Kit** - MIT licensed spec framework
  - https://github.com/github/spec-kit
  - https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/spec-driven-development-with-ai-get-started-with-a-new-open-source-toolkit/
- Custom spec frameworks
- Markdown-based specs in repo

## Community Debate

**When SDD works best:**
- Complex, multi-person projects
- Features with many edge cases
- When team alignment is critical

**When SDD may be overkill:**
- Solo developers on small features
- Rapid prototyping phase
- Well-understood changes

## Spec Template

```markdown
# Feature: [Name]

## Summary
One-sentence description

## Requirements
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2

## Edge Cases
- Edge case 1: Expected behavior
- Edge case 2: Expected behavior

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Out of Scope
- Thing we're not doing
```

## Integration with Codex

1. Create spec in `specs/` directory
2. Reference spec in prompts: "Implement according to specs/feature.md"
3. Ask Claude to verify implementation against spec
4. Update spec with learnings
