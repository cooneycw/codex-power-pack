# gh-pr-merge.sh - Squash-merge a PR robustly from any git worktree layout.
#
# Problem (issue #461):
#   From inside a LINKED worktree - a nested `.codex/worktrees/<name>` checkout
#   or a legacy sibling dir - `gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch` fails
#   AFTER the remote merge has already succeeded:
#
#     failed to run git: fatal: 'main' is already checked out at '<main-repo>'
#
#   gh, having merged and deleted the remote branch, tries to switch THIS worktree
#   off the now-gone branch onto the default branch - which is checked out in the
#   primary worktree, so the local checkout errors and gh exits non-zero. The
#   remote squash still landed (and `Closes #N` still fired); only gh's local
#   post-merge step failed. Callers that trust the exit code read this as a failed
#   merge and stop - a false negative that cost a full re-diagnosis on flow:auto
#   #433.
#
# Transient un-mergeability (issue #485):
#   Right after a `git push`, GitHub is still asynchronously computing the PR's
#   mergeability, so `gh pr view --json mergeable` returns UNKNOWN for a beat and a
#   raw `gh pr merge` fails with "Pull Request is not mergeable". That is a purely
#   transient blip - a re-check moments later returns MERGEABLE and the squash
#   succeeds. To stop that from being a false STOP, poll mergeability before the
#   merge: proceed only on MERGEABLE, hard-stop on a genuine CONFLICTING, and
#   fail-open (attempt the merge anyway) if it never resolves - the post-merge
#   MERGED-state check below stays the final backstop.
#
# Base moved at squash time (issue #502):
#   The pre-merge poll structurally cannot catch a sibling PR that merges in the
#   poll->merge race window: the squash then fails with "Base branch was
#   modified. Review and try the merge again." even though a refetch + re-attempt
#   succeeds moments later (observed live on the flow:auto #485 run itself). On
#   that specific error - and no other - refetch, re-poll mergeability, and
#   re-attempt the squash a bounded number of times before reporting failure.
#
# Branch protection blocks an owner merge (issue #517):
#   With main branch-protected (PR + review + CI required, the #449 posture), a
#   repo owner's squash is rejected by GitHub until it is re-run with --admin, so
#   every owner merge otherwise stalls at a manual `gh pr merge --squash --admin`.
#   Handle it two ways: an opt-in --admin flag that forces the override from the
#   first attempt, and - when a squash fails with a protection-block message, the
#   caller did not pass --admin, and the actor is a repo admin - a single
#   automatic retry with --admin. The override only ever fires for a repo admin,
#   only once, and the MERGED-state check below stays authoritative. --admin
#   bypasses every protection at once (including a red required check), so the
#   auto-retry is deliberately bounded and admin-gated.
#
# This wrapper makes the merge layout-aware:
#   * Linked worktree (cwd's `.git` is a FILE): run `gh pr merge --squash` WITHOUT
#     --delete-branch so gh never attempts the local branch switch, then delete the
#     REMOTE branch ourselves (what --delete-branch would have done). Local worktree
#     + branch removal is left to the caller (worktree-remove.sh / git worktree remove),
#     so the native cleanup path is unaffected.
#   * Primary repo (cwd's `.git` is a DIRECTORY): keep --delete-branch; the local
#     switch to the default branch is safe there.
#   * Either way, verify the PR actually reached MERGED before returning non-zero,
#     so a stray local post-merge error is never mistaken for a merge failure.
#
# Usage:  gh-pr-merge.sh [--admin] <pr-number> <branch-name>
#           --admin  force `gh pr merge --admin` from the first attempt (opt-in
#                    branch-protection override, issue #517). Without it, an admin
#                    override is still applied automatically on a protection-block
#                    failure when the actor is a repo admin.
# Exit:   0 if the PR is merged on the remote; 1 only if it genuinely did not merge.
#
# Env (test hooks - unset in normal use):
#   GH_PR_MERGE_GH             override the `gh` binary (default: gh)
#   GH_PR_MERGE_GIT            override the `git` binary (default: git)
#   GH_PR_MERGE_POLL_ATTEMPTS  mergeability poll attempts (default: 5)
#   GH_PR_MERGE_POLL_DELAY     seconds between poll attempts (default: 2)
#   GH_PR_MERGE_BASE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS  squash retries on "Base branch was modified" (default: 2)
#   GH_PR_MERGE_BASE_RETRY_DELAY     seconds before each such retry (default: 2)
