# flow-helpers-install.sh - Install the flow helper family into <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/
# (issue #590).
#
# Problem:
#   Flow commands call ~14 helpers at the stable <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/ paths the
#   #581 allowlist matches. This installer puts them there from the CPP checkout.
#   During the #662/#663 migration it also accepts a legacy plugin-cache source,
#   so hosts can keep working until they uninstall the installed flow plugin.
#
# Source selection (first match wins):
#   1. A CPP checkout (this script's own dir is <checkout>/scripts) -> SYMLINK,
#      so the helpers follow `git pull` exactly as /cpp:init Tier 2 does today.
#   2. A installed Codex plugin bundle (this script's own dir is <cache>/scripts, no
#      CLAUDE.md one level up) -> COPY. A symlink into a installed plugin cache would
#      dangle when the family is uninstalled; --check detects stale copies.
#
# Usage:
#   flow-helpers-install.sh            # install/refresh, idempotent
#   flow-helpers-install.sh --check    # read-only: report ok/missing/stale, exit 1 if any
#   flow-helpers-install.sh --force    # overwrite even when content already matches
#
# Output ends with a machine-readable verdict line:
#   FLOW_HELPERS: ok | installed | missing | stale | error
#
# Env (test hooks - unset in normal use):
#   FLOW_HELPERS_HOME      override $HOME (install target root)
#   FLOW_HELPERS_SOURCE    override the source dir (skips detection)

# The load-bearing family. flow-start-resolve.sh resolves its live-driver
# sibling via $SELF_DIR, so the guard must travel with it. The advisory guards
# fail open when absent, but a plugin user should keep the zero-prompt lane
# whole, not degraded.
#
# Despite the script's name this is NOT a flow-only list - it already carries
# gh-pr-merge.sh, worktree-remove.sh, friction-log.sh, check-ignored-additions.sh
# and this installer itself. The membership rule is simpler than the name
# suggests: THIS IS THE STABLE-PATH INSTALL SET. Anything that
# templates/claude-settings-permissions.json pre-approves at
# `Bash(<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/<name>:*)` belongs here, whatever family it comes from,
# because that rule matches a command PREFIX - so a helper the rule blesses but
# nothing installs leaves the rule matching a path that does not exist (issue
# #677: cpp-commands-link.sh and install-drift.sh were both missing, so on any
# host provisioned WITHOUT interactive /cpp:init the rule was inert and
# /cpp:update Step 5c fell back to the checkout copy - which the rule does not
# match - and prompted, the exact friction the stable path removes). Do not
# re-litigate a non-flow addition on naming grounds; the template is the
# membership test, and tests/test_permissions_template_link_parity.py enforces it.
