# plugin-sync.sh - keep the packaged per-family plugins in sync with their sources.
#
# Phase B2 of the plugin-marketplace migration (ADR docs/decisions/
# 0001-plugin-marketplace-packaging.md, issue #478) packages every surviving
# command family as an installable plugin under plugins/<family>/. During the
# B1->B4 parallel window the legacy installer and the plugins BOTH ship the
# commands, so the single source of truth stays .claude/commands/<family>/*.md
# and plugins/<family>/commands/ holds byte-identical, checked-in copies. This
# script is the guard that keeps every copy honest:
#
#   plugin-sync.sh                      # --check (default): fail (exit 1) on drift
#   plugin-sync.sh --check [family...]  # check some or all families
#   plugin-sync.sh --write [family...]  # (re)generate plugins/<family>/commands/
#
# The cpp plugin ships help/meta plus the cross-cutting utilities folded in by
# issue #582 (dockers, happy-check, load-best-practices, load-mcp-docs; ADR 0001
# amendment 2026-07-18). The /cpp:init|status|update symlink installer stays
# excluded: it is the legacy surface this migration replaced in Phase B4.
#
# Supersedes the B1 scripts/plugin-flow-sync.sh (issue #477), retired in B4
# (#480). Mirrors the eli5-core-drift.sh deterministic-generator idiom.
# Deterministic and git-free (byte-for-byte local diff, no network) so it runs
# in the git-less CI validate container. Reconcile drift by editing the SOURCE
# (.claude/commands/<family>/*.md) then re-running with --write.
