# worktree-remove.sh - Safely remove git worktrees
#
# If you're inside the worktree being removed, the script automatically
# changes to the main repository first (determined from the worktree's
# .git file) to prevent breaking your shell session.
#
# A worktree CLAIMED by another live /flow session (issue #597) is never
# removed: the claim is checked first and a live foreign owner is a hard stop
# (exit 4), because removing it is exactly the silent-data-loss failure that
# motivated the claim. A self-owned or stale claim is released and removed as
# usual, and --steal is the deliberate override.
#
# A claim only protects a worktree where one was staked, though, and `free`,
# `unsupported` and `unknown` are not claims. So a worktree that no claim names
# is checked a second way (issue #888): if a live process has its working
# directory inside it AND it holds uncommitted work, removal is refused (exit
# 5). --force does NOT suppress that refusal - --force is what every /flow:auto
# Step 7 passes, so a guard it silences never fires where the damage happens.
# --steal overrides it as usual. On a host with no readable /proc the check
# reports `unknown` and falls open, rather than reporting a clean result it did
# not establish.
#
# Usage:
#   worktree-remove.sh <worktree-path> [--force] [--delete-branch] [--steal]
#
# Options:
#   --force          Remove even if worktree has uncommitted changes
#                    (does not override the #888 in-use refusal)
#   --delete-branch  Also delete the associated branch after removal
#   --steal          Remove even when another live session claims it (#597),
#                    or when it is in use with uncommitted work (#888)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  removed (or already absent - stale refs pruned)
#   1  usage error, not a worktree, or uncommitted changes without --force
#   4  claimed by another live /flow session (#597)
#   5  in use by a live process AND holding uncommitted work (#888)
#
# Examples:
#   worktree-remove.sh /home/user/Projects/nhl-api-issue-42
#   worktree-remove.sh ../nhl-api-issue-42 --delete-branch
#   worktree-remove.sh /home/user/Projects/nhl-api-issue-42 --force --delete-branch

# --- Live-occupancy check (issue #888) ---------------------------------------
# The claim above protects a worktree only where one was actually staked. Three
# states leave it unprotected - `free` (no claim ever filed), `unsupported` (git
# too old to lock) and `unknown` (the lock could not be read) - and an unclaimed
# worktree is indistinguishable from an idle one, so it was removed.
#
# That is how a LIVE session loses unsaved work. On 2026-09-13 a session sitting
# in `flow-finish-gate` held a 21KB staged file in a worktree reporting
# CLAIM=free; the only thing between it and deletion was the #503 mtime
# heuristic, whose 30-minute window that session had already outlived by being
# in a long test run. Both guards read "clear" on a checkout that was plainly
# occupied.
#
# So when the claim did not positively name THIS session as owner, ask a second
# question no time window can blind: is a live process sitting in it? A worktree
# someone is standing in, holding work that exists nowhere else, is not ours to
# delete. Unlike the dirty-tree check below, --force does NOT suppress this one:
# --force is precisely what every /flow:auto Step 7 passes, so a guard it

# --- Uncommitted-work check (issue #899) -------------------------------------
# This used to be gated on `--force` being ABSENT, which meant --force deleted
# uncommitted work on any worktree with no live process. "Idle" is not
# "abandoned": an agent session between tool calls has NO process running while
# its worktree may hold hours of work, and #888's observed case was a STAGED
# 21KB spec file. #889's occupancy guard catches that only while a process is
# live, so --force plus an idle worktree was an unguarded delete.
#
# --force no longer suppresses it. --allow-dirty does, and nothing else:
# `--force` means "the worktree is busy, make git remove it anyway", which is a
# different assertion from "I accept losing the contents".
#
# ANY porcelain entry counts, including untracked files - deliberately, and
# measured rather than assumed. The concern was that ignored build artifacts
# would make this fire constantly on the ordinary post-merge path and train
# people to pass the override reflexively, destroying the guard exactly as #888
# destroyed the last one. Measured on three worktrees that had each run the full
# suite and built a .venv: `.venv` present, 41 `__pycache__` directories,
# `status --porcelain --ignored` showing 15 entries - and `status --porcelain`
# reporting ZERO. .gitignore already suppresses them, so they never reach this
# check and the false-refusal surface is not there.
#
# Untracked-but-not-ignored was also zero, which is what decides the simple form
# over splitting tracked from untracked: an untracked file that .gitignore does
# NOT cover is a source file somebody created and never staged, which is exactly
# the work an agent produces and exactly what a split would have deleted.

# --- Unpushed-commits check (issue #899) -------------------------------------
# Nothing in this helper looked at commits at all. `git status --porcelain`
# reports CLEAN for a tree whose commits were never pushed, so the occupancy
# guard saw occupied-clean and proceeded; with --delete-branch the ref then went
# too and the commits survived only via `git fsck --lost-found` until gc.
#
# NOT `git log @{u}..`, which the issue suggested and which cannot work here.
# Measured - it fails IDENTICALLY in the two cases it would have to separate:
#
#   merged, remote branch pruned (THE ORDINARY PATH)  fatal: no upstream configured
#   committed, never pushed (THE DATA-LOSS CASE)      fatal: no upstream configured
#
# So anything built on it must refuse both, breaking every ordinary removal, or
# allow both, leaving the gap where it was. `gh pr merge --delete-branch` makes
# the no-upstream state the NORMAL one, which is why this is not an edge case.
#
# `HEAD --not --remotes` asks the question that actually matters - are there
# commits here that exist on no remote ref - and separates them: empty for a
# merged branch (its commits are reachable from origin/main) and non-empty for
# work that was never pushed. It is git-native, offline, and needs no PR lookup,
# which the sweep's second mechanism does.
#
# Also measured against a STALE origin/main, the ordering most likely to produce
# a false refusal: a server-side merge this clone has not fetched still reports
# empty, because the local origin/<branch> ref covers HEAD before a prune and
# origin/main covers it after. Safe in both directions.

    # reading refuses every removal in any local-only repo. "This repo has no
    # remotes" and "these commits are on no remote" are different facts and only
